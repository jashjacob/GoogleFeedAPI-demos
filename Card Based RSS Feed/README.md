Card based feed layout made with Google Feed API. 

It started out looking like this because I couldn't figure out how to the featured images from the wordpress feed.

After a while of searching, I'm still not able to get the featured images from the rss feed but It's possible to fetch the images from the feed post entry. So now it looks like this, the placeholder.png file is placed if there is no image in the post.
